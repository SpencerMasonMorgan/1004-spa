This project is a file for the company i work for and the intaking of paint. the company recieves pallets of what can be more than 90 cans and these need to be counted. So to speed this up, my project is to have data of all of the paints on csv files.
initially, my project will require adding all of the contents in a longer manner, but after more data gets added then it allows a barcode scanner to look at this csv file and get the content on there to a new csv file displaying the contents of the new pallet.
new2.html is the name of the SPA and its named this way because its the second prototype.
table.php is able to display the contents of a file onto the spa
new 1.css is just the background colour which i used for my first prototype.
send.php sends all of the data to both the master document, as well as a temporary file.
barcode_add.php adds the data of the paint through just the input of the barcode, this also goes onto the temporary file
finalise.php this counts up all of the cans and displays the quantity of the paint, also remvoving duplicates. this gets put onto the final csv file displaying it properly.
